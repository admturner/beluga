# Beluga üê≥ [ ![Download](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/admturner/Beluga.svg) ](https://github.com/admturner/beluga/releases/tag/v1.2.0)

Beluga is a local development environment for WordPress. It uses [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and Docker Compose.

üöß Beluga is still in development, but the `stable` branch should work to provide a basic WordPress development environment.

## System Requirements

- A 64-bit operating system with virtualization enabled and 4GB+ of system RAM. See the [Get Docker guides](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for OS-specific requirements.
- Hyper-V turned on for Windows.
- Docker Engine (included as part of Docker Desktop for Mac and Windows).
- Docker Compose (included as part of Docker Desktop for Mac and Windows).

**Conflicts:** Docker will not work alongside Virtualbox.

## How to Use

1. To get started, download and install Docker Desktop for your operating system. You can follow the [quickstart instructions in the Docker Docs](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/). Docker Desktop comes with Docker Compose preinstalled.
    - **Linux Users**: Instructions are coming soon. You'll probably need to install Docker Engine and Docker Compose manually.
2. To start things up run: `./beluga start`. The first time this runs it'll create a Dockerfile (in `config/containers`) for the WordPress container and an environment file (`.env`) file to store the WordPress database credentials. It'll then build, create, start, and attach to containers for each service specified in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
3. When you receive the "All set" message you can visit [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in a web browser to complete the installation through the WordPress interface.
3. You can add plugins and themes and modify files in the `plugins`, `themes`, and `wordpress` directories.
6. When you're finished you can run `./beluga stop` to stop the running services, and then `./beluga start` to bring things back up. To remove the containers volumes use `./beluga down`. To completely remove all containers, images, networks, and volumes use `./beluga destroy`. You can also interact with the containers using standard Docker Compose commands. See the [Docker Compose CLI reference](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/overview/) for more information.
